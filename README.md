## About my username 🤠
Stewitch can be divided into Stew and Witch. The Chinese literal translation of "炖 巫" is homophonic with "顿 悟", which means "sudden enlightenment" in English.

Quite interesting, isn't it?

## Currently ... 🧐

Learning **Python**, which allows me to make kinds of tools easily.

## Well, at the end ... ❤
Make Programming Great Again!
